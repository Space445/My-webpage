                        Foreign languages such as French, German, Mandarin, and Portuguese are also increasingly gaining importance, particularly in educational and business contexts. 
                        As South Africa continues to engage in global trade and diplomacy, proficiency in foreign languages enhances communication and fosters international relations.

                            How amazing it is to meet people from one of the 
                            most popular townships of South Africa.
                            I had a historical day asking about the culture of Soweto in
                            Johannesburg.
                            What blew my mind away was to know that Soweto is very huge.

                            Honestly speaking, it was my first time 
                            hearing out about the place called Sun City.
                            I once heard that Sun City is a well-known jail in South Africa. I believe in this case I  
                            need to get my facts straight before I share my experience 
                            about the place.
